For the most part, the convention in Linear Algebra, especially when talking about systems of equations or computing products of matrices and vectors is, where possible, to express the the algebra as a matrix vector product, *not* a row vector matrix product.  That is the convention I follow.\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\mathbf A^n \\mathbf x = SteadyState$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If there was only one absorbing state, the vector associated with that is what b would become.  If there were no absorbing states (but certain other conditions were met -- e.g. Perron's theorem) then the steady state of the single dominant (eigen) vector is what b would become. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in all of the above cases, it does not matter what the vector x has in it, so long as its entries sum to one, and they are all non-negative (reals).  Another way of thinking about that is: in the limit, A itself will be composed solely of column vectors associated with the single dominant vector.  If we instead modelled this as $\\mathbf {x^T(A^T)}^n = \\mathbf b^T$, in the limit we would instead see that A is *row* vectors associated with the single dominant vector -- but again, this is a fairly minor point related to transposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that $\\mathbf A$ is a map.  It is a map in the classic linear algebra sense that it acts a linear map from the finite vector $\\mathbf x$ to finite vector $\\mathbf b$ which is another way of saying that $\\mathbf A$ acts as a linear function (in some contexts this is acceptable -- definitions of linear function seem to be inconsistent depending on the branch of math involved).  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a map, in that once we get comfortable with the notation, we'll recognize the underlying graph here. Indeed in most Comp Sci classes discussing graphs / graph theory, students are instructed to store their graphs in either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list (or variant thereof).  Our graph is effectively just a weighted direction graph (digraph) and we are using an adjacency matrix to store its weights.  (In practice markov chains tend to be very sparse and hence you'd tend to use a sparse matrix implementation which combines a lot of the advantages of an adjacency matrix with those of an adjacency list, but that is beyond the scope of this writeup.) \n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example, say we are on starting from a mixed position that is $\\frac{1}{2}$ T and $\\frac{1}{2}$ U,  then our x vector would look like $\\left[\\begin{matrix}0.5\\\\0.5\\\\0.0\\\\0.0\\\\0.0\\\\0.0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\n",

    "\n",
    "*Technical note: in practice you'd want to do that as a for loop implementation which is stricly faster, and will preserve sparsity.  Also note that diagonalizaton may be useful in some cases, though it is outside the scope of this writeup.*\n",

Finally the blue portion represents the 'main game' which are the transient states that you may begin in, but eventually must leave, as n grows large.\n",

    "That is: even if a 'small' n value like 100, -- if you calculate $(\\mathbf  A^T)^{100}$, you'll notice that the output map tells you you're almost certain to end up in an absorbing state, no matter whether you started at T, U, V, or W.  And of course if you start at Y or Z, you are already in an absorbing state and cannot leave.

To derive the first approach one merely needed to understand that our transition matrix is an object called a map, to understand how to relate that to $variance(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]E[X]$, and to understand the underlying geometric series. (Note this first method also allows use to explicitly check for convergence issues with via use of eigenvalues and relating either a diagonalized form of our transition matrix to the geometric series, or if our matrix is defective, we could make the argument via an upperbound -- i.e. use a matrix arbitrarily close to ours but that decays even slower than ours, and demonstrate that we're within the radius of conververgence of a geometric series.  The second method is based on assuming convergence only.)\n",
