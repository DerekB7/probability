    "Also it is worth recalling that the expected value of the number of pieces $E[X] = 1 + n + \\frac{m}{3}$.  Of that the 1 and the n are fixed for any given n. So for any given n, they shift the mean, but do not contribute to the variation around the mean.  The last term $E[Intersections] = \\frac{m}{3}$.  Thus to calculate the variance for our distribution, the only thing that we need to think about it expected intersections.  That is the variance(Pizza Pieces) = variance(intersections of chords).  Thus for the rest of this writeup, we will focus solely on the random variable X, which is the number of chord intersections for some given n_cuts.\n",

    "All of these from example (1) go along the diagonal of $(vv^{T})$, and since $(vv^{T})$ is an $m$ x $m$ matrix, that means there are m of these entries. Another way of thinking about this is you have n items to selects a pair from.  So you have $\\binom{n}{2}$ in that first pair.  Then you select 2 from that first pair and 0 from the residual 'pile'. Thus the calculation is $\\binom{n}{2}*\\binom{2}{2}*\\binom{n-2}{0} = \\binom{n}{2} = m$\n",

The way to think about this one is you have n different chords and you want to select two of them, and then from what remains you want to select two more.  The product of this is the number of ways you you can select two pairs of independent chords from n chords.  (Note that if you look at say the top right and bottom left of $vv^{T}$ you'll see (c,d)(a,b) and then (a,b)(c,d), so while order does not matter within a given tuple, we are saying it does matter between tuples -- if it didn't we'd need to divide our count here by 2!.) \n",

    "Since there are $m^2$ entries in the matrix, we know that this one equals that total minus $u[0,0]$ and minus $u[2,0]$.  That is  $u[1,0] = m^2 - m - \\binom{n}{2} \\binom{n - 2}{2}$.  Another way of calculating this is to say you select a pair from n objects.  This is $\\binom{n}{2}$.  Then you select 1 from that first pair and one from the remaining pile of n - 2 items. The calculation is thus $\\binom{n}{2}*\\binom{2}{1}*\\binom{n-2}{1} = 2\\binom{n}{2}*(n-2) = 2m(n-2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability in there is a touch harder to calculate.  If we use Laurent Lessard's picture (shown here: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-figure-out-how-to-beat-roger-federer-at-wimbledon/) we can see there may be 4 out of 15 cases where two chords intersect.  But if we are careful we recognized for say $P((a,b)) * P((a,c)\\mid(a,b)=1)$, then the bottom picture applies, and one of the three pictures in the second to bottom row applies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That is the second to bottom row has (1) $(a,b) \\cap (a,c)$, (2) $(a,b) \\cap (b,c)$, (3) $(a,c) \\cap (b,c)$, and we want exactly one of these.  An alternative approach inspired by the MITx Probability video (on Beta formula -- my favorite-- ) is to say we have five items $\\alpha_1, \\beta_1, Z, \\alpha_2, \\beta_2$.  Any given arrangement chosen uniformly at random has probability = $\\frac{1}{5!}$.  Now our only real constraint is that Z must stay in that middle slot, and you cannot have $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ on the same side as Z (otherwise no intersection with Z's chord will occur). (Note technically the same constraint about $\\beta_1, \\beta_2$ not being on the same side of Z occurs, but we don't need to worry about it because handling the $\\alpha$'s properly will implicitly take care of the $\\beta$'s.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we have 4 spots that we can place $\\alpha1$, which leaves 2 spots for $\\alpha_2$, which leaves 2 spots for $\\beta_1$  and one spot for $\\beta_2$.  Thus the total acceptable outcomes $= 4*2*2*1 = 16$.  Thus our entry in the probability vector is given by $q[1,0] = \\frac{16}{5!} = \\frac{4*2*2*1}{5*4*3*2*1} = \\frac{2}{15} $\n",
