Notice that while the reasoning is a bit different, we are once again quite interested in how 'overlaps' play in here.

    "Feller on page 278 only considers *(a)* but there is a useful general technique underlying it that this section sought to belabor.  It is worth considering the above technique, and it's similarities with that in 'another look at the theory of runs' in Feller_chp13_notes.ipynb.   \n",

    "As a point of fact for *(a)*, we have a plain vanilla linear recurrence.  Feller goes on to derive the exact ordinary generating function associated with that (with $p=\\frac{1}{2}$), and then point out that there is a dominant root which gives an assymptotic relation and a very good approximation over the short-run.  As your author prefers matrices to generating functions, this post did something similar, where after the recurrence is derived, it is shown in matrix form.  Note that we can in fact solve the linear recurrence exactly (or for larger recurrences: 'exactly' up to numeric agorithm estimates of the roots).  However, these expressions can look a bit unwieldly.  What was done instead in this posting was to make use of exponential tilting, to get the exact same assymptotic relation and high quality short-run approximation.  This exponential tilting approach has the added benef of tieing in with the renewal matrix associated with recurrent events and residual wating times, from Feller p. 381.  Overall this is a very nice linkage of many different concepts.  \n"

    "The probabilistic one is that it is tilting a super/sub renewal function that has a proper probability distribution.  In fact, this approach rapidly generalizes the the countably infinitie case, and we can think of our $\\theta$ as belonging to the OGF for this 'distribution.'  For the non-negative continuous case, we'd naturally want to use $E\\big[e^{tX}\\big]$ with the choice of $t$ that makes this equal to one.  Of course for the positive integers case setting $e^t = \\theta$ recover the OGF approach / approach to what we've done here.  This is the setup mentioned in brief in Karlin & Taylor volume 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the finite dimensional case, we can interpret this in terms of $A$ being similar to the transpose of the Companion matrix. Referencing e.g. \"Vandermonde_Matrices_Permutations_and_Discrete_Fourier_Transform.ipynb\" in the Linear Algebra folder, we can see that $\\mathbf C^T$ has right eigenvectors that are the moment curve -- i.e. slices of the Vandermonde matrix for a given root.  Now the similarity transform being effected here for $\\mathbf A$ is with the reflection matrix $\\mathbf J$ which merely 'flips' the ordering in the eigenvectors. So when we see  \n",

This approach does not extend easily to infinite dimensional cases.  Further while it gives insights into the tilted result -- i.e. the right eigenvector -- in general it isn't easy to figure out the associated dominant left eigenvector would look like  (/what the first row of $\\mathbf A$).

    "This has an explicit and direct comparison in terms of our process being so called \"New Better than Used in Expectations\" (NBUE) meaning that the expected time until absorbtion / renewal is always at least as long for a brand new process than one that has been running for some amount.  (Your author has referred to this as a kind of structured monotonocity in the underlying graph, earlier in this or the Chp 13 writeup... however it seems that this is part of a more general area in stochastics.)  The linkage of the Poisson approximation holds as an upper bound for probability of zero arrivals, irrespective even if we are modelling a much messier process that doesn't have a graphical representation and isn't amenable to matrix modelling.  See e.g. 8.6 \"Applications of Variability Orderings\" on page 273 of Ross's *Stochastic Processes* first edition (which is likely section 9.6 in the second edition of the book).  \n",

Given what else has been written on this page, we may fairly easily adjust our approach to consider other kinds of streaks.  (Stein Chen can be adjusted as well though it requires some additional work for the boundg of the error.)  The gating item with this approach -- simpler as it deals with a polynomial, but fundamentally not unlike finding tilted random variables via Legendre transforms of MGFs-- is we need a root here, which in general requires a specific selection of $p$ and then some care to numerically find (though there are extremely good numeric root finding algorithms). \n",

Or if this is a streaks/runs problem or many other graphs that have a \"feed forward\" nature to them, it may in fact naturally be the case that state 1 is the 'beginning' and state $m$ is the end, and  after every renewal at $m$ it automatically progresses back to the 'begginning'.  (Of course in renewal theory terms, renewals to $m$ begin and start there, but starting at 0 and ending at $m$ is *almost* the same thing -- literally all sample paths are lessened in length by 1 which is an easy correction to deal with as needed.)  The above structure isn't needed per se -- the only essential is that there is one communicating class, but having a certain kind of monotonicity allows us to make additional claims.  \n",

    "\n",
    "the above matrix is still row stochastic.  However, the chain in $\\mathbf A^T$ is a transient chain.  Either by direct examination of the probabilities, or the fact that it is transient, we may confirm $\\mathbf A^T \\mathbf 1 \\neq \\mathbf 1$ i.e. that the dominant eigenvalue for $\\mathbf A$, given by $\\lambda_1$ is $\\lt 1$ (as the graph is transient -- alternatively at most $m$ iterations and application of Gerschgorin discs prove this claim as well.)
