# probability

This is collection of misc. notes on topics of interest in stochastic processes and probability. Some postings are puzzles or identities.  Other postings are rather large writeups on a key topic (e.g. markov chains, renewal theory, martingales) including exercises, and various extensions and applications.  In general the older postings are less deep and more 'raw.'
